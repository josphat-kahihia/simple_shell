/**
 * execute_commands - Run the commands
 * @cmd_main: [temporary] holds the exec name
 * @tokens: execve()'s argv
 * @env: environ
 *
 * Description: This function introduces fairly new concepts. We have execve,
 * that replaces the thread in a process with a new program, and waitpid/sister
 * functions. There are 4 variants of wait, each with their own importance. I
 * chose waitpid() to closely emulate current software models that (I think?)
 * open and manage various child processes, with a few specific sensitive
 * processes that upon status change, the parent jumps in to handle the
 * situation (eg, Antivirus noting that a background update process has been
 * terminated, A browser noting that a critical resource manager has been
 * closed, etc). Fork is rather straightforward as it spawns the various child
 * processes needed, returning the child's actual PID to the parent, and `0` to
 * the child. This doesnt mean that the child cannot see it's PID (or PPID
 * even). See "References" below.
 *
 * Note: execve() requires that the pathname resolves to a binary or an
 * executable shell script whose first line is `#! interpreter`. The shell can
 * be any program, as long as it is in PATH. Why _exit() and not exit() in the
 * child process? To ensure the child process terminates cleanly and without
 * affecting the parent processâ€™s environment.
 *

 * proc man(3) exit, man(3) _exit

 * Links(in_their_respective_orders): Had to remove https from them to silence
 * betty's errors.

 * Did_you_know?: A child process can remove itself from the original Process
 * Group ID (PGID), and create a new one where it is the leader. Oh, the
 * opportunities that brings!
 *
 * Return: the status code if failure, 0 on successs
