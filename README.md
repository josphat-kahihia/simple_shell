# Simple Shell

This is a basic command-line interpreter that mimics a shell. It reads commands from the standard input and executes them.

## Features
- Displays a prompt and waits for user input.
- Reads a line of input and echoes it back to the user.

## Usage
Compile the program using `gcc` and run the resulting executable.

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c -o hsh
./hsh
